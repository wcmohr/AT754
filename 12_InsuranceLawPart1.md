## Insurance Law, Part I

### Tort Law

Tort: A wrongful act or an omission, other than a crime or a breach of contract, that invades a legally protected right.  Torts are civil (or private) wrongs, as distinguished from crimes, which are public wrongs.  Torts are either unintentional or intentional.

Jurisdiction:  A particular court's power or authroity to decide a lawsuit of a certain type or within a certain territory

Tortfeasor: A person or an organization that has commmitted a tort

#### Classifications of Tort

Intentional: torts committed with intent to cause harm or intent to do the act that causes harm (defamation, invation of privacy, trespass, interference with contractual rights, and fraudulent misrepresentation)

Unintentional (negligence): result in legal wrongs, but are not committed with intent to cause harm. 

Physical: i.e. threat of physical harm, false imprisonment, and false arrest.

Non-physical: defamation (libel and slander); malicious prosecution; fraud

#### Application of Laws in Tort Cases
Common law (case law): Laws that develop out of court decisions in particular cases and establish precedents for future cases

Plaintiff: The person or entity who files as lawsuit and is named as a party

Standing to sue: A party's right to sue, as one who has suffered or will suffer a legal wrong or an adverse effect from an action

Transitory cause of action: arises from an offense that could happen anywhere, i.e. sue where driver liver or where caused accident.

Generally, lex loci governs substantive matters, while lex fori governs procedure.  U.S. courts consider the measure of damages substantive, while Canadian courts consider it procedural.  Some courts have moved to the significant contacts rule (apply substantive law of location having more significant contacts to parties).






### Negligence

Proximate cause: wrongful act must have been the proximate, or direct, cause of the harm.


#### Elements of negligence

#### Required proof of negligence

### Defenses Against Negligence Claims

#### Comparative Negligence

#### Releases and Exculpatory Clauses

#### Immunity

#### Statutes of limitations and repose

#### Tortfeasor's Capacity

### Negligence and Landowners or Occupiers of Land
1) Natural Conditions
    * Generally, a landowner is not liable for natuaral conditions that cause injury either on or off the land. **Exceptions**: some courts would consider a slope with frequent landsides to be the landowner's responsibility to control.
    *  No responsibility to correct natural conditions that might create a danger to a **trespasser** (a person who intentionally enters onto the property of another without permission or any legal right to do so).
    *  For trees, in rural areas landowner has less responsibility (no affirmative duty) than in urban areas (reasonable care).
2) Artificial Conditions
   * An owner who alters land in any maner can be liable either for negligence or for creating a **nuisance** (Anything interfering with another person's use or enjoyment of a property).
   * Creates duty to warn trespasser of danger they would likely not discover.
   * Can't create danger to travelers on sidewalk, i.e. with an unguarded ditch.
   * **Attractive nuisance doctrine**: A doctrine treating a child as a licensee, or guest, rather than a trespasser on land containing an artificial and harmful condition that is certain to attract children.
   * Some jurisdictions impose a duty on landlords and tenants of commercial properties to keep adjoining sidewalks and strets in repair because they benefit from these thoroughfares.
3) Duties to those who enter the land or premises
   * Permission to use or enter another's land is called a lecense.  Permitted party is licensee or invitee.
   * **Licensee**: A person who has permission to enter onto another's property for his or her own purposes.
   * **Invitee**: A person who enters a premises for the financial benefit of the owner or occupant.
   * **Express license**: THe oral or written permission to enter onto another's land to do a certain act, but not the granting of any interest in the land itself.
   * **Implied license**: The permission to enter onto a other's land arising out of a relationship between the party who enters the land and the owner.
   * **Public invitee**: A person invited to enter onto premises as a member of the general public for a purpose for which the land is open to the public.
   * **Business invitee**: An individual who has express or implied permission to be on the premises of another for the purpose of doing business.
   * Duty to **licensee**: A landowner owes an affirmative duty to a licensee to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring the person or acting in a way that would increase that person's peril.  Has duty to warn of defects.
   * Duty to Invitees: For invitees, the land occupier owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises reasonably safe and to warn of concealed dangerous conditions, but not dangers of which the invitee is aware.
   * Duty to Trespassers: Owner or occupier owes a trespasser a very minimal duty of care not to cause intentional harm to the trespaser.  Not allowed excessive force in removing trespasser.
